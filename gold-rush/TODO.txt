TODO:
- Convert model files from .obj to mdx with BLP textures. Investigate reforged HD models if convertible. Retain folder structure.
- Auto-generate doodads data into object data file war3map.w3d
  - Can import a few import doodads (ICC, Wrathgrate...) to test first if automation too hard.
- Convert wow.export doodads .CSV file to list of doodads in war3map.doo file
- Implement better terrain generation. Some ideas:
  - Use BFS to generate connected navigatable components. Sort them to generate layers.
  - Investigate integrating tile ramp based on height map and edge map.
  - Generate WoW texture map and use it to assign per tile texture out of 16 chosen tiles.
