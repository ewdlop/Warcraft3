After clearing the forest outskirt of Shadowfang city, the player goes enter the shadowfang city and enjoy urban activities. During this time, a horde of undead notice the cleaned forest area, and build a base there without the player notice. Only when the undead starts attacking the lumber mill, the human notices. Write some dialogue for the Footman in "Lumber Harvest" when he notices this. Short and brief, explain what is happening, express his disappointment that the factory plan will be canceled, and their efforts in clearing the dangerous forest with wolves is gone. Be specific to remind the player about their previous quest Lumber Harvest.

The undead starts sending increasingly powerful waves to attack Shadowfang. The defenders of shadowfang includes Mortar Teams, Paladin, footmen, riflemen. Initially the shadowfang gate blocks their entrance, holding against many waves. Eventually the undead destroys the gate and swarm the city. Write dialogues for those events mentioned above.
