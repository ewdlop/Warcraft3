In quest "Gathering Sheeps," players assist a young shepherd boy named Timmy who has repeatedly lost his flock of sheep after falling asleep. Across three quest levels, players must gather Timmy's scattered sheep and bring them back to him. Each level increases in difficulty, with sheep scattered further away and Timmy offering more valuable rewards for successfully herding them back. As players progress, Timmy rewards them with items and experience points. When not on a quest, Timmy and his sheep either stay home or graze, depending on the time of day. 


In the "Lumber Mill" quest, players are tasked with aiding villagers John and Peter, who need lumber to fix a wheelbarrow. After speaking to John, the player is sent by Peter to investigate the lumber mill southwest, which is overdue for delivering wood. Upon arrival, players find the lumberjacks dead and under attack from Forsaken ghouls. After repelling the ghouls and collecting 750 lumber, players return to report the grim news to Peter, who redirects the urgency to informing the army. John and Peter then head to town, thanking the player for their help and rewarding them with experience points as they prepare for a broader threat.


In "Lumber Mill, Part 2," players must escort villagers John and Peter, along with a squad of footmen led by Knight Gareth, back to the lumber mill to investigate an undead threat discovered earlier. Upon reaching the mill, they are ambushed by undead attackers. While the player and footmen fight off the undead, John and Peter flee back to their home. After ensuring all undead are defeated, the player returns to Knight Gareth to report the heavy losses. Gareth, acknowledging the player's bravery, rewards them and heads off to inform the mayor of the devastating events, marking the grim conclusion of their mission.


In "Lumber Mill, Part 3," following a devastating ambush at the lumber mill, Mayor Nicholas orders an immediate counterattack against the undead. Knight Gareth informs the Mayor about the losses, and together with the traveler, they rally the town's forces for a retaliatory strike. The player, alongside Gareth and town warriors, attacks the undead base, eliminating all undead forces and their buildings. Successful in their mission, the player returns to the Mayor for the final confrontation, got rewarded experiences, vision of the Town, and a town portal scroll.
